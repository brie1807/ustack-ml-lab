# UStack ML Lab

This repository focuses on machine learning system patterns, experiments, and workflows built with AWS services.

The goal is to understand how models move from data to deployment, not just how algorithms work in isolation.

## What This Lab Covers
- Model training and evaluation concepts
- Data preparation and feature engineering patterns
- AWS machine learning services (SageMaker and related tools)
- Batch vs real-time inference considerations
- Monitoring, bias, and model lifecycle awareness

This is not a tutorial repository.
It is a practical lab for exploring how ML systems behave in real-world environments.

## Scope
- Small, focused experiments
- Concept validation and design notes
- ML patterns that can later evolve into APIs or production systems

## Status
Active learning repository — experiments added incrementally.
