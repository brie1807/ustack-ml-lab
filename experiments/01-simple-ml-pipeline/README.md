# Experiment 01: Simple ML Pipeline (Concept-Level)

This experiment documents a simple machine learning pipeline from data ingestion to evaluation.

The goal is not to train a complex model, but to clearly understand how ML systems are structured.

## Pipeline Overview

1. Data ingestion
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Output and interpretation

## Data

- Source: Synthetic or small sample dataset
- Type: Tabular data
- Size: Small (designed for fast iteration)

## Model Choice

- Simple supervised learning model
- Chosen for interpretability rather than performance

## Evaluation

- Basic evaluation metrics
- Focus on understanding results rather than optimization

## System Thinking Notes

- Where data validation would occur
- Where model monitoring would be added in production
- How this pipeline could evolve into a batch or API-based system

## Status

Concept documented.  
Implementation to be added incrementally.
